# CSharp-Web-Development-Basics
In the basic course of web programming, we will introduce you to basic web development principles such as HTTP protocol, sessions and ways of preserving the status, caching of data, various data transfer protocols, security.  We will write our own MVC framework based on C # and MS SQL Server, splitting models, views and controllers, with front-controller and router, supporting all the basic functionalities needed for a modern web application: data visualization, tables, CRUD data operations, forms, paging, validation, notifications, users, sessions, login / logout, and more. In practice, you will learn to create your own C # and SQL Server web applications and understand how web applications work as a structure and how MVC (model-view-controller) technology works in modern web applications. This course sets out the basics of important principles set in the next courses and used in the technologies to be studied.
